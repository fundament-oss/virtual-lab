# virtual-lab

Hard fork of metal-stack/mini-lab. Will try to emulate/aproach the ideas of MEP-18 (and eventually adding Fundament on top of that), while also using different tools (k3d, mise, just). To start, I moved everything to a subdirectory _mini-lab and slowly adding back in stuff to the root as needed. Done this way to start with a clean directory while also properly retaining git history and authorship of the original mini-lab.
